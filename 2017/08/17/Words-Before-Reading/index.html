To read the orginal novel of this show - the series of A Song of Ice and Fire.</p>
<p>I was still a student in college when I watched the first season. At that time, the scences &amp; background of this world did shocked me as I thought it was as great and historical as the World of Warcraft or Harry Potter’s magic world. But after several episodes, I changed my thought completely – this is far better than them, this is the dream.</p>
<p>Old legends and tales of the disappeared dragons, brave honoured knights of the bloody new bron kingdom, mysterious organisations under the unseen wars, masters of manipulators behind the fragile power, young but lost strength of everyone’s nightmare - A world that true heros die, a world that true heros will rebron.</p>

<h3 id="The-First-Book-A-Game-of-Throne"><a href="#The-First-Book-A-Game-of-Throne" class="headerlink" title="The First Book - A Game of Throne"></a>The First Book - A Game of Throne</h3><p>One of the most fascinating and irreplaceable thing of reading is that I can feel every letter of the words to reveal the emotion or hint that the author want to convey. Even after all these years, coming back to the very beginning of this story, despite I have forgotten most details and events that happend this early, still a strong feeling of familiar shown in the lines. Besides, some interesting details that I never noticed appears. And that makes all these reading more interesting.</p>
<h4 id="Deads-awake"><a href="#Deads-awake" class="headerlink" title="Deads awake"></a>Deads awake</h4><p>As the prologue have shown to me, deads in the north already awake. They are a strong and terrifying force beyong the Wall. They start gethering strength from or even before this moment, while each characters coming to the stage. Lords, heirs, bastars, wives, children, killers, innocence, speculators, cowards and talents, all of them start struggling around the center of the whirlpool of the power, as deads just stand up and coming to join the final war. </p>
<p>Although it takes quite a long time, maybe not until this or next week in the show they could have the chance to break though the wall, I still hold a little hope that deads will destory all seven kingdoms and make everything become no more than a story which would be forgotten finally. Considering a important and strong force revealed itself this early, but developing really slow. Such setting makes me reconsider the possibility of this ending. Unlike other novels, there are no final aim which means everyone have their own aim. To kill all deads? To avenge all blood debts? Or to get the iron throne? <strong>Make everything ashes and evil win once.</strong> That would be more like a legendary, more like a real history.</p>
<h4 id="The-unspeakable-omen-to-Eddard"><a href="#The-unspeakable-omen-to-Eddard" class="headerlink" title="The unspeakable omen to Eddard"></a>The unspeakable omen to Eddard</h4><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">A sudden silence descended over the party.  </div><div class="line">Then man looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. </div><div class="line">Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>A broken antler right through the throat of a direwolf. The sign is so obvious that I believe no matter how brave Eddard was, he did chill for a second. It’s not just an omen to house Stark, but also for the king. The crown would shattered like the antler as a fire backed weapon and no more stag will run in these woods ever again. Till now, I can see Eddard is a good decent man, a kind father and a true friend. His children admire him. His wife believe in him. His king rely on him. Nevertheless, normally such man won’t end well. <strong>Old heros will die, to make room for new comers.</strong> </p>
<p>Continue the reading, I think Martin will keep using these animal of houses’ symbol to send hint to readers. It also make sense in the magical world. Every house’s fate would all related with their symbol. As the Targaryen would raise with the dragon reborn, the Starks would be scattered as the children of worlf apart.</p>
